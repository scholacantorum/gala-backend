We need a way to convert a registration to a donation, when it turns out that
it's double-paid (e.g. by the table host as well as the guest), or when someone
can't come, or so forth.

We need a way to handle people who aren't attending but nonetheless are
donating.  Or, similarly, staffers who don't have a spot at a table but still
should have a bidder number.

We need a way to resolve the creation of duplicate guests, i.e., so-and-so is
created as their own guest but it turns out they're also table-host-guest-#5.

We were not consistent on accounting for seats for non-payers like the MC, the
entertainers, the employees, and the politician.  In some cases we called them
comps.  In other cases, we called them guests of table hosts whose tables
weren't otherwise filled.
