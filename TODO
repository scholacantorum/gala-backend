We need a way to convert a registration to a donation, when it turns out that
it's double-paid (e.g. by the table host as well as the guest), or when someone
can't come, or so forth.

We need a way to handle people who aren't attending but nonetheless are
donating.  Or, similarly, staffers who don't have a spot at a table but still
should have a bidder number.

We need a way to resolve the creation of duplicate guests, i.e., so-and-so is
created as their own guest but it turns out they're also table-host-guest-#5.

We were not consistent on accounting for seats for non-payers like the MC, the
entertainers, the employees, and the politician.  In some cases we called them
comps.  In other cases, we called them guests of table hosts whose tables
weren't otherwise filled.

The code currently treats all items the same.  But for reporting purposes we
really do want to distinguish FAN from silent auction from registration.

We need to add a report with guest name and bidder number, sorted both ways.

We need to add a report with auction winners.

We need to add a running total of FAN donations, possibly to be projected.

We should have a way to mark a purchase that is pledged to be paid by non-card,
vs. has been paid, or vs. no idea whether it will be paid.
