We need a way to convert a registration to a donation, when it turns out that
it's double-paid (e.g. by the table host as well as the guest), or when someone
can't come, or so forth.

We need a way to handle people who aren't attending but nonetheless are
donating.  Or, similarly, staffers who don't have a spot at a table but still
should have a bidder number.

We need a way to resolve the creation of duplicate guests, i.e., so-and-so is
created as their own guest but it turns out they're also table-host-guest-#5.

We were not consistent on accounting for seats for non-payers like the MC, the
entertainers, the employees, and the politician.  In some cases we called them
comps.  In other cases, we called them guests of table hosts whose tables
weren't otherwise filled.


Notes after 2024 gala, to be applied for 2025:
- Software generate the reports needed for offline fallback.
- Printing of entree cards.
Won't implement until this year has a need:
- Omit items sold before the event from the auction results printout.
Not going to happen without a rewrite:
- Show data from multiple years, e.g. bidder history.
- Keep track of who has checked in (couples don't always check in together), and
  show on table map to be able to see open seats.
- Handle last-minute notifications of "not coming".
- After allowing use of saved card, that radio button doesn't always remain
  selected.  Reproducible, but seems to be a Vue error.
